# A-Star-Visualization
A visualization of the A* algorithm using SFML and C++

---
Because this project was made using SFML, the .exe requires a bunch of .dll files to run properly so I have included everything in the "A Star Visualization.zip" file.  
Controls are S to place the start node, E to place the end node, Space to find the shortest path, and R to clear an existing path. Left Click to create obstacles and Right Click to remove.

---
Although this project is in a working state I would still like to clean up the code so it will be updated in the future.
